GuessingGame, kwanwantku, 4, Comments on GuessingGame, jbrucker, -, -, -, OPEN, 1. Package names should be in lowercase  not "GuessingGameWithObjects".
2. Don't commit binaries to git.  Use .gitignore  which was mentioned in class.
3. The source code is nicely formatted and the logic is clean  but counting of guesses is incorrect.

GuessingGame, kwanwantku, 3, No iniital hint, jbrucker, -, -, -, OPEN, When the game starts  the game console does not give the user a hint about the range of numbers.
It could be 1 to 10 or 1 to 1 000 000 000.  The user doesn't know. 
When the game starts  display a hint about the range of numbers using hint from GuessingGame.
GuessingGame, kwanwantku, 2, GameConsole should not count the guesses, jbrucker, -, -, -, OPEN, GameConsole is trying to control the counting of guesses by calling getCount.  This is incorrect logic. 

The GuessingGame should count the guesses.
Please look on the internet for "Command-Query separation principle" and think about what it means.
Explain this principle to the TA.

GuessingGame, kwanwantku, 1, getCount is incorrect, jbrucker, -, -, -, OPEN, getCount should return the number of guesses the user has made.
Your method does not do that.
